                  The API operates on a seven-level readability corpus, which
                  was developed by people learning German as a second language
                  on A and B level. The API scans for user inputs and calculates
                  the „Mean Opinion Score“ in short MOS, which directly shows
                  the user the readability of the scanned text in the range of
                  1-7.

                  The 3 biggest features of the German language, with focus on
                  text readability are the following: traditional, lexical and
                  morphological features. The latter has the biggest impact for
                  second language learners, because of its complexity.
                  Traditional features set the base line for text readability
                  classification and builds upon the following 6 features:
                  average length of sentence average number of words per
                  sentence sentence length number of syllables per sentence the
                  “Fleisch-Kincaid score” average word length Lexical features
                  are based on the vocabulary properties and most of them are
                  used to assess readability for second language learners, some
                  of them are: number of adjectives number of pronouns lexical
                  diversity ratio of total number of verbs to adverbs
                  Morphological features are important, because they have a huge
                  impact on text readability for second language learners. A
                  combination of “German finite state morphology (SMOR)” and
                  “conditional random fields (clevertagger)” are used in this
                  API. Some features are: pronominal adverbs preposition used to
                  introduce infinite clause adjective used as noun interrogative
                  adverbs.

                    marginLeft: 20,

                  Mainly 20 features are being used to calculate the Mean
                  Opinion Score for text readability and they are tested against
                  each other to see how accurate they are. Text readability is
                  calculated by using linear regression, support vector
                  regression, polynomial regression and random forest
                  regression. Additionally, the API is using the “Root Mean
                  Square Error (RMSE)”, to measure the deviation of predicted
                  values from actual values, while predicting errors which come
                  by combining traditional, lexical and morphological features
                  to measure the performance of the algorithm to rate the
                  readability.
